    <p>Pre-installation preparation is crucial, and we do it right the 1st time!</p>
    <p>Many clients are surprised by the amount of pre-installation work that carefully goes into their Dream Garage. Locating wall and ceiling studs, navigating around hidden 'hot' wires and air vents, consideration for outlets & light switches and doors & windows, designing around odd shapes and angles, and reparation and smoothing of concrete floors and verticals are all examples of the complexity of a quality installation. Trust us when we say no two garages are the same, and we take the time and care to ensure the finished installation is customized to your garage's unique design, to your budget, and to your complete satisfaction.</p>
    <p>No project is too small, and we specialize in high-end, finished garages.</p>
