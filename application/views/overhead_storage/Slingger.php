    <h1>Slingger Overhead Storage</h1>

    <p>Slingger’s simple, automated storage solutions are a revolutionary, new way to organize and store your personal items. Mountain bikes, golf clubs, fly fishing gear, and holiday decorations are stored and accessed within seconds. Car top carriers, canoes, and bikes are raised and lowered right from the roof of your car without any lifting. Since items are stored at ceiling level, valuable belongings are protected from everyday foot traffic, in addition to elements like snow and rain. Floor space also becomes available for other uses. Install several Slinggers and your garage can be transformed from chaos to clean. This Slingger solution comes with: one 2-Bike Slingger, one Golf Club Slingger, one Stuff Slingger, one Car Top Carrier Slingger, and one Ladder Slingger.</p>
