            <h1>Customer Requirements</h1>
            <p>The following are some requirements we have for our customers. Should you have any questions, comments or concerns about any of the following please feel free to <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>contact/">contact us</a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1st Choice Garage Outfitters will insure that our workmanship not only meets, but also try our utmost to exceed your expectations. We will make your construction project a success. It is, however, the responsibility of the home owner or general contractor to protect the floor once completed. Most damages occur within the first few days when the floor is put into use prior to fully curing. All 100% epoxies, regardless of brand, take at least 3-5 days to fully cure at room temperature. We recommend minimal usage after 24 hours and as for vehicular parking after 4 days. Repair of damaged flooring will cost extra.</li>
                <li>Floors should be clear of all debris and made vacant prior to the installation date. Any fragile or valuable objects on or near the floor should be removed by the customer prior to our arrival. 1st Choice Garage Outfitters will NOT be responsible for any damages that may occur in moving any fragile or valuable objects. Additional costs may also be incurred if we have to spend time moving your equipment or supplies.</li>
                <li>The concrete grinder that is used has vacuum attachments and is virtually 95% dust free. However, due to the opened state of the floor during the preparation process, there will be excess dust that will remain in the work area until we do a full clean up prior to epoxying your floor. 1st Choice Garage Outfitters will NOT be held liable for any dust contamination; therefore, it is the responsibility of the owner to protect valuable items from dust contaminations.</li>
